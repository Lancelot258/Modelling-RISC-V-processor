# Modelling-RISC-V-processor
 Cycle-accurate simulators of a 32-bit RISC-V processor
### Input
>  imem.txt: this file is used to initialize the instruction memory.
> 
>  dmem.txt: this file is used to initialize the data memory.
> - These two input file should be put in the same file, should be put the absolute dir addresss in the variable 'ioDir'
>
### Output
>  DmemResult.txt: shows the output of data memory after finishing the last cycle.
> 
>  RFOutput.txt: shows the values of the registers after finishing the last cycle.
> 
> StateResult.txt: stroe the state information after finishing each cycle.
